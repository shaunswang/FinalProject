# FinalProject
Final project 
We are attempting to code a behavioral experiment using a posner cueing paradigm. A cue will be presented, pointing to one side of the visual field. 
Two images will then be presented, one of a subject with a gun, the other a subject without a gun. 
The test subject must press the 'F' key if the cue points towards the gun, and must press the 'j' key if the cue does not point towards the gun. 
Reaction time as a function of accuracy will be studied, and we will attempt to determine if the cueing had any effect on the accuracy/reaction time.
